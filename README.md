* programmed Circuit : entirely a simple equipment and a backbone is programming.
* Unprogrammed Circuit : using only electronic parts.

we will show an example for each one independently.


## Repository Contents :
* programmed Circuit Folder
* Unprogrammed Circuit Folder

This is the submission for week 2 tasks of the Electric path at Smart Method training of 2022.
