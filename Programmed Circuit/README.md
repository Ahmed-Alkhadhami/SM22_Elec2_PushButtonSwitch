# Programmed Circuit :

This is a example of a circuit that can be controlled on/off using only one push Button.  
the used components are basic , so the major work is in the code.

<br />


## Component List :
* Arduino UNO
* 2 Resistor (1 kΩ)
* push Button
* LED

## Idea of the code :
the main idea is that The code :
* will save a Boolean state (false=low) at a variable called **lightToggle** and send it to the LED , which will indicate the state of the LED initially (will change with every press).
* will compare between the previous state of the button , and the instant state.

if the they were the same , then the button is not pressed . Otherwise , the two states will vary resulting for the **lightToggle** to change to the opposite state (whether it was ON or OFF)
